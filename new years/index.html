<h1> We all make resolutions each year... <br /> but how often do we stick with them? </h1> 
<p> We're lucky that a bunch of us graduated with a set group of accountabilty buddies. And what better way to actually stick to a resolution, than if you have someone who is doing it with you? Take a second, fill out the form, submit, and you, along with many other Startup Insitute folks, will have a accountability platform so those New Year's resolution's don't fall to the wayside. <br/ > <br /> 

Connect with each other if you have similar goals, or maybe just help a friend with differing ones, and keep each other on track. </p>
